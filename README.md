## Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to the project please do so. There are a number of ways you can help:

### Examples

We need plenty of domain and problem examples to fully test the parser. If you have any examples that will test features
not yet covered by the integration tests that you are happy to have published in the project, please send them through.
Bonus points for writing integration tests to parse and check them.

### Bugs

Please raise bug reports as issues on Github. Pull requests to fix them are welcome.

### Features

If you'd like to request a feature, please raise an issue on Github. If you want to work on developing a feature
yourself you're very welcome, but it would be best to raise an issue and discuss first.
